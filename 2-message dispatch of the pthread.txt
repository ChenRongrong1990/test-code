Attention: construct data from console is not required, do not implement that logic. Never write code use fgets scanf, getchr, cin or other functions to get input from console.
If you do need data for test, just set the value of variables.
Requirement:
The program creates two thread pools whose names are "key" and "other". Every thread pool includes 3 threads. the relation of thread pool name and thread id the thread id should be printed.
The program can receive strings from stdin. The string which begins with "key" will be delivered to "key" thread pool. Others will be delivered to "other" thread pool.
The thread proc function needs to  print thread id and the received strings.
When customer types "exit", the programe will release all the resource and then exit.
