Attention: construct data from console is not required, do not implement that logic. Never write code use fgets scanf, getchr, cin or other functions to get input from console.
If you do need data for test, just set the value of variables.
Implement a parking management system:
Parking lot has several floors. Each floor has different number of parking space.
To implement parking functions: according to the strategy, guide the user to park to the designated floor.
Support the two different strategies:
Strategy 1: guide the user to the floor which has the most empty parking space.
Strategy 2: guide the user to the floor which has the most empty parking space until this floor is full.
Implement query functionality including
query the total parking space of each floor
query the empty parking space of each floor
query one car's location according to its license plate number
 
Implement pick-up functionality

实现一个停车场管理系统：
停车场有多个楼层，每个楼层的车位数不同
实现停车功能，根据策略，引导用户停放到指定楼层。支持两种策略： 
存放到剩余车位最多的停车场
存放到空置率最高的停车场
实现查询功能，能查询每个停车场的车位数、空位数
根据车牌号，查询汽车停放的车位
实现取车功能
